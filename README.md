# Employee_Feedback_app
This webapp will take employee feedback and measures how happy the employee is.
I have developed this web application using Spring boot,jsp,html.
Developed Entity class to take data from user and to save it in database.
Configured application.properties file
With the use of handler methods in controller layer, i made possible to move from one jsp page to another.
A simple Mysql database schema is used in this project.
I have created controller, service and repository layer, followed by spring mvc.
Simple logic of measuring employee hapiness wrote in service layer.
This app must be pulled in spring tool suite or any other tools that supports spring and see the working.

I have used maven dependencies such as tomcat server, jstl tags etc in this project.
STS(Spring tool suite),MySql workbench etc tools are used in this project.
This project is developed in Java platform, which is very widely used for development of web applications.
