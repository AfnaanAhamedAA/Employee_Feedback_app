# Employee_Feedback_app
This webapp will take employee feedback and measures how happy the employee is.
I have developed this web application using Spring boot,jsp,html.
i have created controller, service and repository layer, followed by spring mvc.
simple logic of measuring employee hapiness wrote in service layer.
This app must be opened in spring tool suite or any other tools that supports spring and see the working.
